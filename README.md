# 🛡️ TechAV - iOS 18+ Shortcut Scan Tool

**TechAV (TechAntivirus)** is a free and simple **iOS Shortcut** that helps you scan your device for unusual activity or files.  
No app installs, no ads — just one tap from the **Shortcuts app**.

---

## 🧪 What It Does

- Lists large files and unused media
- Flags uncommon file types
- Helps you decide what to review or remove
- Shows quick system insights

---

## 🚫 What It Doesn’t Do

- ❌ Does not delete files automatically
- ❌ Not a full antivirus (no real-time protection or malware removal)
- ❌ Not a replacement for proper system security

This is a **scan tool for awareness**, not a full security suite.
